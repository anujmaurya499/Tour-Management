.Using linked list data structure, design a CRR (Campus Return Requests)
system for students who want to return to the campus. Each node of list named
REQUEST should hold the name of the student (First_Name, Last_Name), roll
number and unique ID based on order in which request was placed (for example 5
for request placed on Friday being the 5th day of the week). Out of these, the
requests of only first N students would be granted/accommodated on the actual
CONFIRMED list. The rest would be put on a WAITLIST. If any student wants
to cancel his/her request, the corresponding node will be deleted from all the lists.
New names would be added from WAITLIST to CONFIRMED list in case there
is a vacancy and the corresponding node will be shifted from the WAITLIST.
Requests will be made only from Monday till Saturday. It is guaranteed that only
one person does booking on a particular day. Also it is guaranteed that all names
will be unique and there will be no duplicates.

Implement the following methods in your program:

1: will be followed by name of the student, roll number of the student and day of booking.
Include the student on REQUEST list
2: will be followed by name of the student. Cancel the request for the student
3: Print REQUEST list
4: Print CONFIRMED list
8: Print WAITLIST list

The data for the program would be read from file CRR.txt. The first line would contain N.
The remaining lines will start with operation code and followed by relevant data wherever
needed. For request, it would be name of the student followed by weekday on which
request is placed. For cancelling, it would be just the name of the student. See the sample
output file to see style of printing.
